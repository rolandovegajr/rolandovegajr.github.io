# Rolando Vega's Homepage

Hello, my name is Rolando Vega Jr. I am currently in the IT Data Analytics program at Western Technical College. I have always been interested in the IT field but have not had the courage to take a step forward until now. I am returning to school because I want to be able to provide financial security and stability for my wife and daughter. My wife and daughter are the most important things to me, which is why I am striving to do the best I can. I am a quick learner and a motivated individual. I currently work for Kohl's in Onalaska as a Store Associate. I have 10+ years of customer service experience.

As I mentioned before, I have always wanted to pursue a career in IT but did not know which path to go down. I chose data analytics becuase I want to make a real impact in my next career destination. 

Short Term Goals: Help my daughter collect more Pokemon cards, Do well in my classes, Find an IT internship for next year

Long Term Goals: Graduate with my degree, Pay off my Car
